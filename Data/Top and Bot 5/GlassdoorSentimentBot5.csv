IP,5,Good hours and a good pay.Some days can be tough.
IP,1,"Terrible Management. Pay and benefits were decent but working in PS&D negates any of that.Shift work never allows you to have a sleep cycle. The workers including myself, always complained of never getting proper sleep. That may be why everyone was in such a crappy mood.Management was supposed to be in charge of training but I was not properly trained for over a month and when they changed trainers, that trainer was worse than the prior one. During the review sessions the trainer would tell managers that I didn’t know the job yet I would work days without supervision. So that was a lie. There’s a lot of politics going on at this company and they are not trying to hide it. During the orientation HR made it clear IP was Progressive in their politics. The individual trashed Trump and bragged about wearing a F the police. How is that acceptable in such a large and public company.
I assume I was let go because I supposedly was not learning fast enough but I don’t know because they let me go over a phone call, telling me I was terminated, good luck! International Paper lied to me from the interview process. They told me I would be working on the Industrial side of the plant and they decided to place me in shipping and receiving. I should have known from the start the management were not honest people."
