JLL,5,Great Opportunities. Very focused on training and career growth for employees. Many opportunities within the company. Employee experience varies with account. 
JLL,5,"Great community of individuals to work with.  PTO was flexible and could be used for anything at any time (sick/vacation/personal)
- Amazing Leadership on the account I worked for (global tech company)
- Decent work/life balance as far as schedule. Day-to-day was nonstop but it made the hours go by fast.
- Always pushing you to learn more and providing opportunities to grow
- Knowledge sharing!! This was so different and truly amazing that everyone across the account shared their knowledge and I was able to share mine, along with new ideas and initiatives.
- They seem to promote internally and encouraged you to look for career opportunities.
- Management and Leadership were transparent on everything, which was greatly appreciated and made me respect them even more.
- Diversity and Inclusion and Culture were a top priority. There was continuous effort and follow through in this area. - Healthcare option wasn't great. Paid thousands of dollars out of pocket yearly for the middle healthcare package. - HR was very difficult to communicate with, if they ever got back to you at all. - Not a wide range of positions to grow or pivot into. Some people were very limited in career growth opportunities. - There needed to be better communication between us (JLL) and the client when it came to procedural changes that affected our job performance"
JLL,3,"Working on a client site that as some great perks and working with an awesome team.""Working on an account at JLL you are constantly chasing your tail with no clear direction. As a manager we are told how we have to push and push our employees to do more and more but unable to compensate them when year end reviews come around. Health insurance here is a joke if you are looking to spend $200 - $300 per visit plus a copay, I would suggest working elsewhere. There is ZERO confidence in the assigned HR Business Advisor they seem to never know a policy or blame the teams for that lack of knowledge of a process. Everyone is aware of the incompetence but no one ever says anything knowing their voice won't be heard....you just can't win. Lack of support from corporate. It has been a long 2 years and anything nice Managers want to do for their employees has to be from their pocket. Training and virtual gathering won't solve poor team morale.If JLL put time back into your employees you will have less turnover and happier people serving the client. And for such a large organization having to pay upwards of $200/ per month with subpar insurance is insane.

Practice what you preach not just because it the """"cool"""" thing to do."""
JLL,2,"The company has lots of resources and is willing to do what it takes to grow and win new business. There are some really excellent real estate professionals on the team who know a lot about the industry and work to get the best deals for their clients. Fast-paced environment where you can do meaningful work. The corporate environment sucks a lot of life out of the local markets, so that it is difficult to achieve local goals. There are a lot of workarounds at the local level to accommodate inflexible corporate policies. Seems like they are many smaller firms, not one cohesive unit."
JLL,4,"Good place to work. Great Challenges, decent pay, lots of training. A bit green Chaotic management Understaffed Not centered on skill excellence"
JLL,2,"Salary typical for role and experience; work from home flexible mostly; decent vacation and holidays. ""Health insurance is ridiculously expensive and charges a very high surcharge for adding spouse if spouse also has health insurance available; managers don't receive training in being effective, managing performance or communication of any type; huge company means that there are many layers/miles/time zones between you and the person who can help with your manager. Tighten things up with manager training. The offerings when I was there were more style than substance. The office I worked in was initially great about Covid, saying that no one had to return until they were comfortable, then pivoted 180 degrees and became almost belligerent. And this was well before vaccines were available.

Offices are nice but a nightmare of a lack of sustainability efforts which is funny given JLL's attempts to position itself as a sustainability leader. Tons of paper and copying waste; plastic cups and bottles and cutlery; k cups for coffee.

HR is allegedly a global effort but I found HR for my area completely removed, checked out and disinterested."""
JLL,5,Job offers flexibility and I am part of a team that truly supports one another. Job is not 8-5 but you do have to occasionally work weekends and evenings. There is always a trade off but with the right approach you can balance it all
JLL,4,"Good people, a lot of turnover.I've been fortunate to be on some great account teams and it was terrific to be able to keep a job during the pandemic.

Work from home is awesome. ""Massive shifts in account responsibilities are in no way correlated to pay, which happens everywhere, but seems much more prevalent here from my experience. If you're placed on a problem account you better get used to putting out fires every day. Turnover is pretty annoying because you'll have no answers for a client about a document or payment from less than 2 years ago that a former employee dealt with. Keep improving training and maybe look to have non-Portfolio training for the new hires that won't be using it.

Your hands are tied in this department but more opportunities for progression and pay increases would keep good people around."""
JLL,3,"Good: Advancement Opportunity Available / Bad: Too ""Woke""Healthy stream of growth opportunities.""Often feels as though employees are either spread too thin or simply not knowledgeable enough to offer meaningful support. Consolidate time and increase productivity by better utilizing the systems and platforms already available to JLL.

Most importantly: For the morale of our teams, we have to discontinue forced trainings relating to diversity. Logging people's races & genders in order to create a """"diversity score"""" is extremely toxic; and racist by definition. For most reasonable people, this is insulting and the resentful work environment it creates has a negative impact on the performance of JLL and its teams. Instead, we should move these discussions be a product of disciplinary measure, if/when they're actually needed""

JLL,4,"Great company. Great company to work for, a lot of opportunities for personal development and growth.Men hold a lot of the leadership positions despite qualified women being here. It's still a very male focused company or if it is not, the office does not feel that way."
