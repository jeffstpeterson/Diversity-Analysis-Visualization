Check to see how they rank now and then 20 years ago. The company ranked #1 in 1990 wasn't spending money the company ranked 10 now is. Can I get the spending of DEI in these organizations. Build upon examples of storyboard and visualizations. This is growing part of the project. 

In today's world a DE&I program is socially relevant. The question is does this social relavance translate into an defined impact on the the profit of the corprotion. More imporetantly does a company with a develped DE&I see measured results in the corporations metrics on the Profit and Loss statement.
